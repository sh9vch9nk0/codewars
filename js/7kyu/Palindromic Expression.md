## Palindromic Expression (7 kyu)

Welcome to yet _another_ kata on palindromes!

Your job is to return a string with 2 requirements:

1 . The first half of the string should represent a proper function expression in your chosen language.

2 . The string should be a palindrome.

Wait... that's too easy -- let's add one more requirement:

Call `x` the sum of the character codes of the full string we want to return.

To pass the kata, make sure the function represented in your string will return `x` when it is given as an input.

### Solution

```
  let palindromicExpression = () => "x=>xx>=x";
```
