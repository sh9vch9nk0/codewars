## Leap Years (7kyu)

In this kata you should simply determine, whether a given year is a leap year or not. In case you don't know the rules, here they are:

- Years divisible by 4 are leap years,
- but years divisible by 100 are not leap years,
- but years divisible by 400 are leap years.

Tested years are in range `1600 â‰¤ year â‰¤ 4000`.

### Solution 1

```
function isLeapYear(year) {
  return year % 4 === 0 && year % 100 !== 0 || year % 4 === 0 && year % 100 === 0 && year % 400 === 0;
}
```

### Solution 2

```
const isLeapYear = year => new Date(year, 1, 29).getDate() == 29;
```
