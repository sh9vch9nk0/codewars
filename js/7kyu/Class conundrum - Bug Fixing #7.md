## Class conundrum - Bug Fixing #7 (7kyu)

Oh no! Timmy's `List` class has broken! Can you help Timmy and fix his class? Timmy has a `List` class he has created, this is used for type strict arrays (which Timmy calls Lists).

When Timmy calls the `count` property of the list it still remains at `0` when adding items.

Also it fails when Timmy tries to chain the adds e.g.

`myList.add(0).add(1)`
